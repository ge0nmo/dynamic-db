# ðŸ”€ Dynamic Multi-Tenant Database Switching in Spring Boot

This project demonstrates **how to dynamically switch between multiple databases** at runtime using Spring Boot, JPA, and a custom `AbstractRoutingDataSource`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Case

A `MainMember` belongs to a `Team`, and each team has its own separate database. When a request comes in with a member code:

1. The app looks up the member from the **main database**.
2. It extracts DB credentials from the member's `Team`.
3. It dynamically **registers and switches** to the appropriate **branch database**.
4. Then it queries data (like `GameScore`) from that branch DB.
5. Finally, it **clears the context** after the request is processed.
